# The Bank of Random Credit Authorizer (.NET)

This project contains a class representing a client-side service component that randomly authorizes or denies
a credit card purchase.
The purpose is to use this authorizer to demonstrate how to reduce tight-coupling by using dependency injection.
This project provides a non-deterministic result for making a purchase, which cannot be used in a unit or
integration test.

When paired with the Everyone is Authorized project (https://github.com/jmussman/everyone-is-authorized-dotnet)
it provides the foundation to introduce the Adapter
pattern and add a runtime reason for using dependency injection.
